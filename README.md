# Airbnb-Analysis

#Summary
Airbnb is one of the biggest online accomodation renting platform. I tried to analyse the given data at first hand, and develop a predictive model that can predict the price of a listing using different inputs.

#Introduction
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.
